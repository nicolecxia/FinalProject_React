# FinalProject_React
The final project has the goal to demonstrate learning and using the fundamentals of React Native as learned in class. The project will be a functional and operational application. You cannot use past assignments as your final project.

## Requirements
### The application MUST use an implementation of React Native through EXPO or NATIVE CLI.
### The application MUST implement hooks like states and props.
### The application MUST retrieve and update data from and to an external database like Firebase or another API of your choice. 
### The application MUST have an authentication process using an external database source like Firebase or another API of your choice. It means that the application MUST have a login, a logout and a signup process. It may require at least an email and a password. You DO NOT need to create confirmation emails, unless you want to.
### The application MUST solve a specific problem, which can be a real one or a made-up one, can be simple or complex, it's your choice.
### The application MUST persist session or user specific data even when the user is logged out. It means that the user can safely log out and the data on the application will be saved in the database.
### The application MUST have the code available for analysis and review.
### If you want to do MORE than is required you are free to do so. I just recommend you not to complicate things too much as you have more assignments for other courses. The more features you have the more issues you may have as well to solve.
